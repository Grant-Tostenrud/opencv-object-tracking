# opencv-object-tracking
This is an app that allows users to input a video containing an object and evaluate how much space the object covers in the frame using OpenCV.

This app takes in an input video and outputs three things:
  - A video with a transparent path of the object over the course of the input video.
  - A single image of the final path of the object at the end of the input video.
  - A plot along with a quantitative percentage of area covered using color detection.

There could be many uses for this app such as testing robotic cleaners or even could be expanded to track athletes during a soccer game.
